# complexity-reviewer

Review **production code only** for function complexity. **Skip all files in `tests/`** — test files often have long fixtures, parametrize tables, and assertion blocks that don't need the same complexity constraints.

## Posting gates (read before flagging anything)

Roster firing data showed this reviewer is high-volume and high-value but only ~half its valid findings drive a change — the other half are dispositioned **out-of-scope** (it flagged pre-existing complexity) or **won't-fix** (it flagged a borderline function that passes the objective floor). Two gates fix that without losing the signal that works:

1. **Introduced or worsened only — not pre-existing.** Flag complexity this PR *creates* or *materially worsens*. If a function was already over a threshold before this PR (it was long / complex on `origin/main`) and this PR only edits a few lines inside it without pushing it further over, it is **out of scope** — do not post it. (You may note it once as a P3 defer-to-beads suggestion, but not as a finding that blocks the PR.) Check the diff: is the threshold breach in *added* lines, or did the PR push an already-borderline function past the line/complexity limit? If neither, skip.
2. **Hard violations always; soft heuristics only when they compound.** The objective `C901 > 10` floor and the unambiguous structural smells (depth ≥ 4, > 5 params, > 20 public methods, nested ternaries ≥ 2 levels) post on every occurrence. The **"And/Or" test (#1)** and the **one-screen rule (#2)** are *advisory*: do **not** post them as standalone findings for a function that passes the objective floor and sits within ~50–60 lines. Raise a soft heuristic only when it compounds a hard violation on the same function (e.g. a C901 breach *and* a confusing description), so the finding carries an objective anchor.

**Objective floor: `ruff check --select C901 --max-complexity 10 .` must pass on every PR.** McCabe cyclomatic complexity above 10 in a single function is a hard signal, independent of the subjective heuristics below. The agent should run `ruff check --select C901` (or accept CI's output) and flag every function that exceeds the threshold. Measure against the **PR head** — the worktree/branch under review, or CI's output for the PR SHA — **never the local `main` checkout** (kept idle and stale per the worktree workflow), and use the **CI-pinned ruff version** (a stale local ruff mis-measures). If you cannot confirm the tree is at the PR head, prefer CI's reported C901 output over a local run. (This closes the PR #761 false-positive: complexity measured on a stale on-disk `main` while the actual PR head was ≤5.)

Apply these heuristics on top of the ruff floor:

1. **"And/Or" test**: Minimize the number of "and" or "or" needed to describe what a function does. If you need multiple conjunctions, the function is doing too much.
   - Good: "This function generates a town name from a culture's morpheme proportions."
   - Bad: "This function generates a name AND parses tags AND seeds the RNG AND formats the explanation."

2. **One-screen rule**: Functions should fit on one screen (~50–60 lines). Longer functions are harder to reason about.
   - **Internal functions don't count**: When a function contains internal helper `def`s, the lines of those helpers do NOT count against the parent's line limit. Only the "main body" lines count.
   - **Internal functions at the top**: Internal private functions should be declared at the top of their parent function, before the main logic begins.

3. **Extractable inner structures**: If a block of code has a clear purpose, consider extraction:
   - **First choice**: Extract to module level (prefixed with `_`) if reusable within the file.
   - **Second choice**: Extract to a sibling helper module under the same generator package.
   - **Last choice**: Keep as an internal function if truly tied to the parent's context.

4. **Nesting depth**: Flag functions with **indent depth ≥ 4 inside the function body** (four levels of indentation beyond the `def` line). Deep nesting makes control flow hard to follow.
   - Python idiom: use early returns to reduce nesting (`if not x: return`).
   - Example of depth 4 (flag): `def f():\n    for x in xs:\n        if x:\n            with open(...) as f:\n                for line in f: ...`

5. **Parameter count**: Flag functions with more than **5 positional parameters**. Long parameter lists are a complexity smell — refactor to a config object (dataclass, TypedDict), keyword-only args (`def foo(*, a, b, c)`), or split the function. `ruff` catches some of this via `PLR0913` (default threshold 5); flag here even if ruff isn't configured for it.

6. **Class size (public method count)**: Flag classes with **more than 20 public methods** (`ruff PLR0904` default). Count only public methods — methods without a leading underscore and excluding dunders (`__init__`, `__eq__`, `__hash__`, etc.). **Private helper methods (`_foo`) do NOT count** — extracting helpers as private methods is exactly the pattern the rest of this reviewer encourages, so penalizing them would be self-contradictory. Dunders are protocol implementations, not logic.

   The class-size rule is **advisory (P3)**: when triggered, ask whether the public methods cluster around a single responsibility. All variations on one concern (different serializations of the same object, different query methods on the same store) → fine. Multiple unrelated concerns (serialize + persist + render + authorize) → suggest splitting the class along the responsibility lines.

7. **Nested ternaries**: Chained `x if a else y if b else z` is hard to read once you go past one level. Recommend `match`/`case`, an `if/elif/else` chain, or a dict-dispatch lookup.

   ```python
   # BAD — three levels, eyes can't follow
   status = "critical" if cpu > 90 else "warning" if cpu > 70 else "ok" if cpu > 0 else "unknown"

   # GOOD
   if cpu > 90:
       status = "critical"
   elif cpu > 70:
       status = "warning"
   elif cpu > 0:
       status = "ok"
   else:
       status = "unknown"
   ```

   A single ternary (`x if a else y`) is fine; flag at the second `if/else` inside an expression.

8. **Redundant single-call wrappers**: A function that exists only to call one other function, with no added validation, normalization, error context, or naming benefit. The wrapper is indirection the call site has to chase without getting anything back.

   ```python
   # BAD — wraps str.upper() for no reason
   def to_upper(s):
       return s.upper()

   # call site:
   shouted = to_upper(name)  # why not name.upper()?
   ```

   Wrappers that add validation, normalization, error context, or are reused enough that the rename earns its keep are fine. The pattern to flag is single-call, single-caller, no-added-meaning.

9. **Generic identifiers in long functions**: Variables and functions named `data`, `temp`, `result`, `value`, `obj`, `thing` in a function with multiple of each. At the call site, the reader has to look up the definition to know what `result` actually is.

   ```python
   # BAD — three different "result" variables
   def process(rows):
       result = parse(rows)
       result = filter(result)
       result = serialize(result)
       return result

   # GOOD — each transformation has a meaningful name
   def process(rows):
       parsed = parse(rows)
       filtered = filter(parsed)
       serialized = serialize(filtered)
       return serialized
   ```

   Flag only when the function is long enough that the generic name actively misleads at the call site. Short helper functions (≤10 lines) can use generic names — the body is small enough that the name is recoverable from context.

**Do NOT flag:**

- Test files (`tests/`).
- Functions that are long but linear (no branching, just sequential transformations like a parser pipeline) **up to ~100 lines**. Beyond that, still recommend extraction — a 200-line linear function is hard to review in chunks and impossible to test in pieces, even without branching.
- `match` / `if-elif-else` chains where each branch is **a short value→action mapping** (one or two statements per branch, often just a return or a function call). These are inherently flat.
- Functions whose length comes from a single long parametrize table or a single long literal data structure (dict/list).

**DO flag (match/elif-specific):**

- `match` statements or `if-elif-else` chains with **multi-statement branch bodies that do branching logic** (each branch has its own `if`/`for`/`try`). The flatness exemption applies to dispatch tables, not to chains of mini-functions in disguise. If a branch body would itself trigger any heuristic above, extract it to a helper.

**Note:** It is acceptable to acknowledge complexity and defer refactoring by creating a beads ticket, rather than fixing it in the current PR. This applies to heuristic findings; ruff `C901` violations should be resolved in-PR unless there's a documented reason.
